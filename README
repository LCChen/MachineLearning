 I used this repository to store some recipe of setting up docker images for Machine Learning on NVidia GPU.
 The recipe is based on the work of Lab41, from https://github.com/Lab41 and the NVidia Docker.
 1>Please install the right GPU driver for the NVidia Display Card.
 2>Please install NVidaDocker (plugin and its speical command line tools)
 3>Please make the docker image using keras-cuda
 4>Please make the docker image using keras-cuda-jupyter
