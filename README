 I used this repository to store some recipe of setting up docker images for Machine Learning on NVidia GPU. I love learning ML, 
 but i do not want all its stuff mess up my local environment. I had once spent one week to setup the environment and then screwed up, :(. 
 So search the internet, found those very help sources from docker, NVidia Docker and Lab41 and others. I spent some time doing experiments on them.
 So far i am pretty satisfied. 
 The recipe is based on the work of Lab41, from https://github.com/Lab41 and the NVidia Docker from https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
 1>Please install the right GPU driver for the NVidia Display Card and also the docker stuff.
 2>Please install NVidaDocker (plugin and its speical command line tools). Please follow the instruction of the NVida Docker. 
 3>Please make the docker image using keras-cuda/native_nvida
    cd keras-cuda/native_nvida
    1-build.sh
 4>Please make the docker image using keras-cuda-jupyter
    cd keras-cuda-jupyter
    1-build.sh
 5> Run the container
    2-run.sh
